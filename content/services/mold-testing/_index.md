We specialize in moisture and water damage investigations, mold testing, and advanced building forensics using defensible, standards-based methods. With thousands of projects completed across South Florida, we align with both IICRC S500 (water damage) and IICRC S520 (mold remediation) to deliver full-scope assessments and protocols.

- Lab sampling and spore trap analysis
- Source moisture mapping and infrared imaging
- IICRC S500-aligned water damage investigations
- IICRC S520-aligned remediation protocols
- CIH documentation for real estate, insurance, or litigation
- Full inspection-to-clearance consulting — most firms can test; few can interpret. We do both.

We also offer full inspection-to-clearance consulting. Most firms can test; few can interpret — we do both.
