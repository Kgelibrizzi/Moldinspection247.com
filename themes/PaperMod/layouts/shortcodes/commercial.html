      <p><strong>What is more important than breathing? What’s in the air you breathe?</strong> Let us test and see!</p>
  
      <p>
        Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) affects the elderly, children, people with health conditions like asthma, heart disease,
        and many others, and those just plain sensitive!
      </p>
  
      <p>
        EPA states that indoor air quality is <strong>5–20 times more polluted than outdoors</strong>. Yet we spend most of our time indoors—and we can control indoor air quality.
        So let’s get started now! <strong>Call us! 954-782-0472 / 941-228-5525</strong>
      </p>

        Modern energy-efficient homes mean less “breathing” and more recycled contaminants:
        pet dander, VOCs, furnishing emissions, cooking particulates, finishes, upholstery, mattresses, flooring, carpet,
        bioaerosols (bacteria, mold, mildew, dust mites, cockroach allergens, etc.), smoke, pressed wood, synthetic candles,
        humidifiers, pesticides, excess moisture, insulation, cleaning products, personal care products, and more. <strong>Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer.</strong>
      </p>
  
      <p>
        High humidity, small leaks, dead air spaces, and recycled air all contribute to poor indoor air quality.
