We investigate and document chemical odor complaints, VOC exposure, and air quality risks using calibrated instrumentation and lab-validated sampling. Whether related to off-gassing, emissions, or IAQ disputes, our defensible reports help resolve tenant claims, regulatory citations, or post-remediation clearance.
