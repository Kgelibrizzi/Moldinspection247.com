      icon_path: /images/icon-mold.svg
      content: We perform comprehensive mold testing using air sampling, spore traps, and surface collection methods. As a Licensed Florida Mold Assessor and Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH), we don’t just collect samples — we interpret results with defensible clarity for real estate, insurance, or litigation needs.

    - title: Moisture Mapping & Infrared
      id: moisture-mapping
      icon_path: /images/icon-mapping.svg
      content: Moisture is often the root cause of mold. We use infrared (IR) thermal imaging and moisture meters to identify hidden leaks, condensation, and building envelope issues. This allows us to provide practical recommendations before costly damage spreads.

    - title: IICRC S500 Water Damage Protocols
      id: water-damage-protocols
      icon_path: /images/icon-flood.svg
      content: Our evaluations align with IICRC S500 standards for water damage restoration. We identify the extent of water intrusion and guide appropriate drying and remediation methods to prevent secondary mold growth.

    - title: IICRC S520 Mold Remediation Protocols
      id: mold-remediation-protocols
      icon_path: /images/icon-spray-bottle.svg
      content: For established contamination, we design protocols consistent with IICRC S520 (engineering controls, work practices, PPE, and post-remediation verification). Technical practices include water categories, classes of intrusion, and conditions of contents where applicable.

    - title: Clearance / Post-Remediation Verification
      id: post-remediation-verification
      icon_path: /images/icon-clipboard.svg
      content: We conduct clearance inspections and testing to verify work meets industry standards. CIH-reviewed, defensible reports so the project is truly complete.
