    - title: Mold Testing 
      icon_path: /images/icon-mold.svg
      content: We perform comprehensive mold testing using air sampling, spore traps, and surface collection methods. As a Licensed Florida Mold Assessor and Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH), we don’t just collect samples — we interpret results with defensible clarity for real estate, insurance, or litigation needs.

    - title: Moisture Mapping & Infrared
      icon_path: /images/icon-mapping.svg
      content: Moisture is often the root cause of mold. We use infrared (IR) thermal imaging and moisture meters to identify hidden leaks, condensation, and building envelope issues. This allows us to provide practical recommendations before costly damage spreads.

    - title: IICRC S500 Water Damage Protocols
      icon_path: /images/icon-flood.svg
      content: Our evaluations align with IICRC S500 standards for water damage restoration. We identify the extent of water intrusion and guide appropriate drying and remediation methods to prevent secondary mold growth.

    - title: IICRC S520 Mold Remediation Protocols
      icon_path: /images/icon-spray-bottle.svg
      content: For established mold contamination, we design remediation protocols consistent with IICRC S520. These protocols include engineering controls, work practices, PPE, and post-remediation verification steps to ensure mold is safely removed.

    - title: Clearance / Post-Remediation Verification
      icon_path: /images/icon-clipboard.svg
      content: After remediation, we conduct clearance inspections and testing to verify that the work meets industry standards. Our reports are CIH-reviewed and defensible, ensuring your project is truly complete and occupants are safe.

    - title: Advanced Building Forensics
      icon_path: /images/icon-forensic.svg
      content: We go beyond testing. Our advanced forensics identify underlying building science problems such as HVAC issues, air pressurization failures, condensation, or drainage defects. This expertise prevents recurring mold and protects long-term property health
